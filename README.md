# DSC 291 Final Project

## Proposal
Integrated analysis of scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data for HCC patients.

#### Hypothesis: 
Integrating scRNA-seq data and scATAC-seq data may reveal novel theraputic targets by finding the direct correlation between chromatin 
accessibility and expression. It can also identify cell-type-specific 
enhancer activity, and regulatory dynamics at the single-cell level.

#### Data:
scRNA-seq: GSE156625 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE156625)

scATAC-seq: GSE227265 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE227265)

#### Methods:
